Hello! My name is Allan. I was born in Caracas, where I spent a good part of my childhood before moving to another small town in northern Venezuela. I am truly passionate about mathematics and the way it allows us to rethink complex, everyday phenomena as higher instances of formal interacting objects. With the goal of deepening into the fields of combinatorics and theoretical CS in mind, I decided to come to Berlin, one of the most academically exciting cities in the world. Meanwhile, I work as Research Programmer at the [Algorithmic Dynamics Lab](https://www.algorithmicdynamics.net/) of Karolinska Institute and proudly collaborate with the [Algorithmic Nature Group](https://algorithmicnature.org/). Before that, I served a handful of universities, institutes and schools in Venezuela, both conducting (amateur) research and helping create public awareness of national science. This humble blog, in which I discuss advancements in well-known fields like Data Science and Machine Learning as well as other hidden pearls, is just an attempt to communicate all the enthusiasm I have gathered along the way.
