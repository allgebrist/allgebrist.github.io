Hello! My name is Allan. I was born in Caracas, where I spent a good part of my childhood before moving to a small town in northern Venezuela. I am truly passionate about mathematics and the way it allows us to rethink complex, everyday phenomena as higher instances of formal interacting objects. With the goal of deepening into the fields of combinatorics and theoretical CS, I decided to come to Berlin, one of the most academically exciting cities in the world. I have worked as a Research Programmer at the [Algorithmic Dynamics Lab](https://www.algorithmicdynamics.net/) of Karolinska Institute and collaborated with the [Algorithmic Nature Group](https://algorithmicnature.org/). Before that, I served a handful of universities, institutes and schools in Venezuela, both conducting (amateur) research and helping create public awareness of national science. This humble blog, in which I discuss advancements in well-known fields like Data Science and Machine Learning as well as other hidden pearls, is just an attempt to verbalize all the enthusiasm I have gathered along the way.

In addition to 'sciency stuff', I like to spend time on my newly discovered obsession for languages. Other than Spanish, my mother tongue, I have learned English at a comprehensive level, German at a reasonably good level and am now teaching myself Russian (I already understand quite a lot of it in written and verbal form). I also naturally read a lot of French and Italian, and ocasionally some Dutch. Please, do not be surprised if you see constant shifts in my posts' language of choice!

I also like art, boxing and boxing art. If you feel unsure about what the latter means, please refer to [this example drawing](https://twitter.com/vasyllomachenko/status/920788644377645056) I made of Vasiliy Lomachenko, two-time Olympic gold medalist and three-division world champion. The fact that the best living boxer shared my blurry artwork on Twitter is permanently going to lead my list of bragging rights.
